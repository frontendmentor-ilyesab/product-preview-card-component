## Overview

This is the first challenge in the **Building Responsive Layouts Frontend Mentor Roadmap**. As the roadmap name indicates I tried to focus on making the design works across as many devices as I could.

It was a fun and challenging exercise. I tried to use viewport units and calc functions to scale font-size and padding to reduce the code nested in media queries.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using a combination of the `clac()` function and `vw & rem` units to scale font-size and spacing based on the user's viewport width and font preferences.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about the different techniques used to scale typography and spacing responsively without the use of media queries such as `clamp` function and `minmax` function for grid.

I didn't use either in this challenge as it seemed I achieved something close to the design by only using `calc` and a couple of media queries but I'm interested in those and their applications in responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) - This tool let you view the design across different devices at once. I configured it with a couple of devices (phones, tablets and desktops) to see if the design looks good on some of the standard devices on the market today.
